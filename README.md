# Floppy-Ball
Ball jumping past oncoming walls and earning points with each wall passed.
NOTE: If looking to open game in IDE you must import all the processing libraries (PApplet) from processing.org - https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/ useful link to tutorial on how to set up processing in Eclipse!
All variables and methods used from processing in the DriverClass have a 'parent' extension before the processing library variable/method is used.
